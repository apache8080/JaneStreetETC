Jane Street ETC Fall 2017 UIUC

All the scripts made during the event.

final_js_client.py was our main bot that we used during the event. It made basic bond trades that were guarenteed profit
and then we built an arbitrage bot that would trade the inefficiency in an ADR market where VALBZ was the real stock
and VALE was the ADR.
